# Carousel

This carousel is made with Nuxt3, Composition API (script setup) and SCSS. Images are fetched from API (https://api.nuxtjs.dev/). The carousel can be swiped with both mouse click and mouse movement/touch movement. It is looped (so swipe away ðŸ˜‰) and utilizes cookies to store the last displayed image and start from it after refresh.

```bash
# yarn
yarn install
